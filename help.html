        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            This game is simulating natural selection.
            Firstly, we have entities. These are the "living creatures"
            that are trying to adapt to their environment. The environment
            is the background color. The closer the entity's color to the background
            color, the bigger biological advantage they have.
            For example, a red entity has far better chance to survive in an orange
            background than a blue entity. The entities that survive, clone themselves
            with a chance of mutation, that is defined by the user.
        </p>
        <h4>Background color</h4>
        <p>
            The user has the ability to define the background color,
            the environment that the entities are trying to survive in.
        </p>
        <h4>Mutation Possibility</h4>
        <p>
            The user has also the ability to define the possibility of a mutation to
            happen during the cloning of each entity
        </p>
        <h4>Mutation Change Rate</h4>
        <p>
            This setting defines how higher or lower the color (rgb) can get.
        </p>
        <h4>Initial Entities Number</h4>
        <p>
            This setting defines the initial number of entities that randomly
            created.
        </p>
        <h4>Entities killed every generation</h4>
        <p>
            This percentage defines the percentage of the least adapted entities
            killed every generation.
            For example, if the user sets this to 30, and there are 100 entities,
            after a generation, there will be 70 entities, which will of course
            clone themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user is also given the ability to pass many generations once.
        </p>
